# üöÄ Intellexa AI - Enterprise 

## One-liner
"Intellexa AI helps answer questions from company or user documents using RAG technology."

## Overview
Intellexa AI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system that allows users to ask questions directly from PDF documents.  
It uses LangChain and Google Vertex AI to split, embed, and search documents efficiently, providing accurate answers with source references.

## Problem Statement
Many companies have important information spread across many PDF documents.
Finding the right information takes a lot of time and effort. This slows down work and decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** - with LangChain framework
- **ChromaDB** - vector database with persistence
- **PyPDFLoader** - Load PDF documents
- **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** - Split documents into manageable chunks
- **VertexAIEmbeddings** - Convert text into embeddings for semantic search
- **Chroma Vector Database** - vector database with persistence
- **Gemini LLM** - Generate answers from retrieved context
- **Professional error handling** and modular design

## Methods & Key Insights
1. **PDF Loading**: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs.  
2. **Text Chunking**: Splits long documents into smaller chunks for better semantic search.  
3. **Embeddings & Vectorstore**: Converts chunks into embeddings and stores them in Chroma for fast retrieval.  
4. **Context Retrieval**: Searches for the most relevant chunks based on user queries.  
5. **Answer Generation**: Uses Gemini LLM to generate answers from retrieved context.  
6. **Sources Tracking**: Displays the source document and page for transparency.  

**Key Insight:** Combining RAG with vector search ensures accurate, context-aware answers from large documents.

## Output / Model
- Users enter a question in the terminal.
- System retrieves the most relevant chunks from the PDF(s) and generates a concise answer.
- Each answer includes **source references** with document name and page numbers.
